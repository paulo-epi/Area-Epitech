</div>

## Home Page

Once you are logged in, you will be redirected to the home screen. From there, you can navigate through the two different sections of the app: `workflows` and `services`.

### Workflows

The workflows section allows you to see and create different workflows. Each workflow represents a set of actions and reactions that you can pick, and enable it or not.

Each workflow action and reaction in the list displays a brief description and an icon or image that represents the action/reaction.

</div>

### Services

The services section displays a list of available services. You can connect to a service by logged in yourself to it to access and be able to use different actions/reactions.
