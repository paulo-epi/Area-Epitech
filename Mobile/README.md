## Getting Started

This project requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Expo](https://expo.io/) to be installed on your computer.

To get started, clone this repo and run the following commands:

```bash
cd Mobile
npm install
```

Then, to run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone or in your simulator to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```bash
npm start --reset-cache
```
